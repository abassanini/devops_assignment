# Objective
This is an assignment for DevOps Digital Position. The goal is to demonstrate your skills on DevOps Technologies without devoting too much time to it, estimated 4 hours.
You are free to use whatever you consider on terms of frameworks, libraries, environments...
The deliverable of the exercise will be the source code of it, some installation steps and any other documentation you might want to generate to demonstrate how you will finish this assignment on production.

# Assignment 
## Application
Create an application that counts the number of unique visitors and displays this statistic. Keep this information in a database.

### Requirements:
- Python or JS
- PostgreSQL server

So, this app has some endpoints:
- / - main page with all data shown
- /version - JSON response with current app version

## Infrastructure
Produce a system diagram of your solution deployed to either Azure(preferred), AWS or GCP (it’s not required to support both cloud platforms).
Using Terraform to create this infrastructure as code.

## Containerization
Create a deploy using docker and docker compose to be able to test this application locally.

## CI/CD
At this stage you already have project, that can be built and verified for some kind of issues. It’s time to automate it.
Choose one of CI/CD you like:
- Azure Devops
- GitLab
- BitBucket 
- Jenkins
- GitActions

## Monitoring
Briefly explain how you would monitor your application, and what system you would use for it

## Documentation
Documentation should include key points such as:
Also, you may write additional docs like:
- What technologies were used and what tools are needed to use your solution?
- How to start this service from scratch using your solution?
- How to scale number of servers to take more load?
- What is application deployment architecture diagram?

To draw diagrams you can use Draw.io, CloudCraft or even ASCII Art. Include them in your repository too.

# Deliverables
Please deliver the code on your favorite repository, but give us access ☺
